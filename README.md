# stylegan2-by-pytorch
A PyTorch implementation of StyleGAN2. 

## under construction 

The original code of StyleGAN2 is based on Tensorflow so I replicated it with Pytorch. Pre-trained networks are obtained using Tensorflow, and these weights and biases are translated into the ones for the Pytorch implementation.
